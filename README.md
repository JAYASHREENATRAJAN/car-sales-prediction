# 🚗 Car Sales Prediction  
A machine learning-based web application to predict car purchase prices using Flask and a trained deep learning model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the price of a car a user is likely to purchase based on demographic and financial attributes. The model is built using deep learning and is deployed with Flask for a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Project Structure  

- `car_purchase.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `app.py` → Flask backend to handle user requests and return predictions.  
- `templates/` → HTML files for the web interface (`home.html`, `test.html`, etc.).  
- `models/` → Trained model (`car_price_modelui.keras`) and scalers (`scalerui.pkl`, `y_scalerui.pkl`).
